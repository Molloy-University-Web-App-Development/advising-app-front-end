        Description="New media refers to all media technologies invented since the television. That means computers, the internet, video games, virtual reality, memes, and so much more! Studying new media means you look at the content, histories, and cultural effects of these different kinds of media. By studying new media we can better understand things like how social media can sway a presidential election, how an app like Uber can completely change the way we work and travel, or how playing video games became something that can make you a millionaire."
